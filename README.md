# unicord

A unicord bot with a few new extensions.

Discord Bot Extension 1 - DnD Random Encounter Generator
This module of the app will take in a command and generate a random encounter for the popular tabletop RPG DnD. This will include enemies and loot encounters for a user. This module will also be able to roll any amount of dice the user would like. The module will also allow the user to create a random boss and generate character statistics. 


Discord Bot Extension 2 - PTU (Pokemon) Random Encounter Generator
This module will be very similar to the DnD portion, although it will be more in-depth with a database holding a lot of information from the game and abilities it can randomly generate. This module will also be able to roll any amount of dice the user would like.


Discord Bot Extension 3 - Chat Modifier (Anonymous Messaging, font, color)
This module of the app will allow the discord bot to take in a command to send a message to someone anonymously through direct message. Along with this, you can add certain fonts and colors to your messages in the server.


Discord Bot Extension 4 - Inventory Manager (Any type of object)
This module will be able to hold information from the user, such as an item from DnD in JSON format.


Discord Bot Extension 5 - Favorites Holder (Quickly recall and open links)
This final module will have the ability to hold links the user would like to have saved and be able to open them from in the app, such as a pizza storeâ€™s website or a youtube video.
